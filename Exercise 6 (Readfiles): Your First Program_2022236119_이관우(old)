[We read the file:]
# Read the Example1.txt

example1 = "/content/gdrive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/example1.txt"
file1 = open(example1, "r") #"r"는 example1 객체를 읽을 수 있는 상태로 만들자

[The name of the file:]
# Print the path of file
file1.name
/content/gdrive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/example1.txt

[The mode the file object is in:]
# Print the mode of file, either 'r' or 'w'
file1.mode
'r'

[We can read the file and assign it to a variable :]
# Read the file
FileContent = file1.read()
FileContent
'This is line 1\nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3\n(empty)\nThis is line 4\n\n'

[We can print the file:]
# Print the file with '\n' as a new line
print(FileContent)
This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
(empty)
This is line 4

[The file is of type string:]
# Type of file content
type(FileContent)
str

[We must close the file object:]
# Close file after finish
file1.close()

[A Better Way to Open a File]
# Open file using with
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    FileContent = file1.read()
    print(FileContent)

This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
(empty)
This is line 4

[The file object is closed, you can verify it by running the following cell:]
# Verify if the file is closed
file1.closed
True

[We can see the info in the file:]
# See the content of file
print(FileContent)
This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
(empty)
This is line 4

[We don’t have to read the entire file, for example, we can read the first 4 characters by entering three as a parameter to the method .read():]
# Read first four characters
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
This

# Read certain amount of characters
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(7))
    print(file1.read(15))

This
 is 
line 1

This is line 2

[Here is an example using the same file, but instead we read 16, 5, and then 9 characters at a time:]
# Read certain amount of characters
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(16))
    print(file1.read(5))
    print(file1.read(9))

This is line 1
T
his i
s line 2

[We can also read one line of the file at a time using the method readline():]
# Read one line
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print("first line: " + file1.readline())
    print("second line: " + file1.readline())
    print("third line: " + file1.readline())

first line: This is line 1

second line: This is line 2

third line: This is line 3

[We can use a loop to iterate through each line:]
# Iterate through the lines

with open(example1,"r") as file1:
        i = 0;
        for line in file1:
            print("Iteration", str(i), ": ", line)
            i = i + 1;

Iteration 0 :  This is line 1

Iteration 1 :  This is line 2

Iteration 2 :  This is line 3

Iteration 3 :  (empty)

Iteration 4 :  This is line 4

Iteration 5 :  

[We can use the method readlines() to save the text file to a list:]
# Read all lines and save as a list --> 자주 사용함 
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    FileasList = file1.readlines()

[Each element of the list corresponds to a line of text:]
# Print the first line
FileasList[0]
This is line 1\n

# Print the second line
FileasList[2]
This is line 3\n

FileasList[3]
(empty)\n

FileasList[4]
This is line 4\n
